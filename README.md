# Card-Game

This is a simple card game

It helped me to learn Javascript Arrays and different array methods. It even helped me to learn Quadratic functions. O(n^2), if you will. I used that to load the cards into an array. It was a good learning experience.

It's horribly styled so I didn't add it to my website but it works as intended... "MOSTLY"!
